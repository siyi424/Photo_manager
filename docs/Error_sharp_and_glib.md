I use the wsl2 Ubuntu and manually install libvips which is a C++ library. 
It's very awful to run C++ here. 
And glib is the key library in linux system like Ubuntu for its GNOME. 

**The cause of this problem is the bad performance of the glib !!!
I use sharp to generate many thumbnails and save them in a temp folder.

Solution: raplace glib by jemalloc.**
