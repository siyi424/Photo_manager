# The Art of Promise
Promises are used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations in a more elegant and organized way. They provide a cleaner alternative to callback functions, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous tasks in sequence or parallel.

The art of linear use of Promises involves chaining multiple asynchronous operations together in a clear and readable manner. This is achieved using the .then() method, which allows you to specify what should happen after a Promise is resolved (fulfilled) or rejected.

to conclude: 
```
with status parameters, promise could handle asynchronous operations; 
with .then() methos, promise could use result.
```

PS: use `innerHTML` to add new element, then you can easily check whether it is loaded.
